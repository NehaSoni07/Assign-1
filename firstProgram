#1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). 
#The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

i=2000
x=[]
for i in range(1999, 3201):
    if (i%7 == 0 and i%5 !=0):
        x.append(i)
        i = i+1
    else:
        i = i+1
print(x)
